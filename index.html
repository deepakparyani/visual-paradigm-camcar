        <h3>
        On 20-21 september of 2014, at geek hours hackathon we(@deepakparyani, @shubhmay) made this JS app.
        We are using trackingJs for image processing. We had an alternative image processing library like processingJs but due to time constraints
        and some other issues we did not use processingJs(Which is awesome too!).

        <h2>
          What is camcar?
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Its a simple game which is to be played\controlled not using a console or keyboard but with color gestures.
          Check the demo <a href="https://github.com/deepakparyani/visual-paradigm-camcar/start.html">here</a>

        <h3>
          You'll need a desktop environment(mac, linux or PC), webcam, browser (chrome or firefox) and colored strips- Yellow and Magenta.
          currently its not supported for mobile devices.
          For fun, i made yellow and magenta thumb rings:

          How to play?
        </h2>
        
        <h3>
          First allow the application to use camera.<br>
          Before starting you can check the car turn left or right at its own position
          by using the defined colors.<br>
          Keep the distance around 15-20 cms from your webcam <br>OR<br>
          you'll get to know at which distance it detects the colors.
          Press enter to start. Object/Car starts moving and you have to 
          give directions using yellow and magenta color.
          Application is set to defaults: (and you can not change for now)<br> 
          left turn: <span style="background-color:yellow">yellow</span><br>
          right turn: <span style="background-color:magenta">magenta<span><br>
